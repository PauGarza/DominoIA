# DominoIA

## Introduction

DominoIA is a Prolog-based project designed to simulate a domino game with artificial intelligence. The game allows players to experience dominoes in a digital format, incorporating strategies and algorithms to enhance the gameplay. This project is a demonstration of applying AI concepts within a classic game framework.

## Features

- AI-driven domino game logic.
- Implementation of game strategies in Prolog.
- User interaction for a dynamic gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with DominoIA, you will need a Prolog interpreter installed on your system. SWI-Prolog is recommended for its comprehensive features and compatibility.

### Installation

1. Download and install SWI-Prolog from [SWI-Prolog's official website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PauGarza/DominoIA.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.

### Running the Game

To start the game, open your Prolog interpreter and load the `P2_Domino.pl` file:
```
?- ['P2_Domino.pl'].
```
Then, initiate the game by calling:
```
?- startGame.
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Acknowledgments

- The game logic and AI strategies are implemented in Prolog, showcasing the potential of logic programming in game development.
